        <h3>Happy Quinn</h3>
        <p>Happy has a violent interior and exterior. She portrays anger so she can turn any pain into that. She isn't just physically violent, though, she is also verbally violent. Within even the pilot, she uses threatening quips to, possibly, defuse her annoyance with their fear. For a girl who lived within the foster system, she did have to defend herself and that mostly is where she developed her violent tendencies. Not to break or cry, probably to keep herself from being judged, just like Walter had found her (except in a different way). She can be open to people similar to her, such as Ralph, but she also acts that way to him to make sure he doesn't end up like she did; in a foster home being misunderstood. She is very fearful to trusting others and getting hurt. If anything, she is a significant character, but harder to control.</p>
